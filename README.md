# DeepSentiment

Welcome to the Deep sentiment application. This application provides us with a service to show the real time web sentiment of the internet through a web application.

The Deep_sent_browser directory contains files which can enable us to load the application into the chrome web browser as an extension. The file popup.html can also be opened in any web browser and be used as a regular web application.

The code is written in javascript entirely so the web application will run on any major browser.

The src directory contains the files which have been implemented for the server and the backend.

EventServer.java is the main function to be run to start the server.

The classpath describes the various libraries needed for running the server.

The major libraries needed are stanford nlp, twitter 4j, facebook java api, json api, jetty libraries.
